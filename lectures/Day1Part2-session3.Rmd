## Basics of debugging
From [impatient R](http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/impatient-r/more-r-errors-and-such/):

- 1.Donâ€™t panic.
- 2.Guess why it is happening.
- 3.Check if your guess is correct.
- 4.Repeat steps 1 through 3 as necessary.

## Basics of debugging

- Read the error message
- Use names, dim, str, lapply(data, class) to see if your data looks the way you think it does
- Keep simplifying code till you get the simpelest code that reproduces the error
- Replace your data with toy datasets from within R.
- Add print statements to get an indication of where things are breaking down (particularly useful in apply statements and loops)
- Break your code down to see which chunks work and which do not
- Look inside objects. Do they look like what you want?
- Build projects from simple scripts to increasingly complex

## Debugging user defined functions

- Add stop commands to your code
- Add try commands to your code

```{r}
myFunction <- function(x){
	if(!is.numeric(x)) stop("x must be numeric")
	temp <- c(mean(x, na.rm=TRUE), sd(x, na.rm=TRUE))
	return(temp)
}

myFunction(c(1,2,3,4,5,6))
myFunction(c("a", "b", "c"))
```
