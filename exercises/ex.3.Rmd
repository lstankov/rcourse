Slicing and Dicing
--------------

1. Download the PISA achievement data from here and the PISA psychological variables from here
2. Create and save a new R script
3. Use the following template to answer the questions

Questions:
-------------
1. Set use.value.labels to FALSE adn then TRUE what differnce does it make to the data?
2. Describe the psychology data by gender, yearInSchool, and IMMIG (immigration)
3. Use tapply to replicate some of the results above for ESCS (ses)
4. Use the apply command to get means for varibles "BELONG to ESCS"
5. Replace mean with other functions you have learnt (e.g., max)
6. Create a GPA variable from PV2MATH, PV2READ, PV2SCIE, and PV2PROB
7. ADVANCED: Combin apply and tapply commands to replicate aspects of describeBy output
8. ADVANCED: Create 5 GPA variables from the set of plausible values. Use apply to get a combined mean

Agregation and Merging
---------------------

1. Add to the template below

Questions
---------
1. Merge pisaAch with pisaPsych
2. Aggregate the GPA score you developed above by school id
3. What is the correlation between GPA, aggregated GPA and SCMAT?
4. ADVANCED: Try regressing SCMAT on GPA and aggregated GPA
5. ADVANCED: If you created the 5 GPA variables above, aggregate all five. Look at the package mitools and the imputationlist function and think about how you could package your data for analysis (you should have 5 datasets each with 1 of the GPA variables). Look at some other functions in the mitools package, how could you run regression with this sort of data?

```{r}
### Question Set 1 ###
# read in the PISA achievement data
  # see ?read.spss in the foreign package

# read in PISA achievement data

# See describeBy in the psych package

# tapply functions

#apply functions
  # 1 =  apply by row
  # 2 = apply by column

### Question set 2 ###
# merge data
  #see ?merge

# aggregate data
  # see aggregate
  
 # use names to change the names in your new aggregated data set

 # merge your aggregated GPA into your pisa dataset 


## END ##
